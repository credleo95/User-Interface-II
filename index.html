   <p> Omarius comes from a non traditional tech background. He started in the music industry and found that his skills could be used elsewhere. Therefore, he pursued another path which isn't always seen as artistic. 
       However, he is here to show that humanity, artistry, and matters of the soul can be translated through technology as well. It's not just the tool, it's the person behind the tool.

       These projects demonstrate my abilities, passions, and aspirations for the usage of technology in the future. We are here to benefit each other and inspire growth for the future. 
       Each project is just one example of how much we can change the world.
